## üì• Setup & Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Clone the repository**:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AL-SUN/WelcomeHome.git
cd WelcomeHome
```

---

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Install dependencies**:

1. **Frontend**: Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)  installed.

```bash
cd frontend # Navigate to the frontend folder
npm install
```

2. **Backend**: Make sure you have Python and pip installed.

```bash
cd ../backend # Navigate to the backend folder
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Configure the Database**

1. Ensure **MySQL** is installed and running on your local machine.

2. Update the `config.py` file in the `backend/` folder to match your MySQL database settings (user, password, host and port).

---

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Import the Database Schema & Seed Data**

1. Start your MySQL server.

2. Import the SQL files to set up the database schema and populate it with sample data. 

   Use graphic interface to import `projectTableDefs-v2.sql` and `examplesData.sql` in `backend` folder.
   Or run following commands (replace `your_db_user` and `your_database_name`):

  ```bash
  mysql -u your_db_user -p your_database_name < backend/projectTableDefs-v2.sql
  mysql -u your_db_user -p your_database_name < backend/examplesData.sql
  ```

---

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Start the Development Servers**

1. **Start the backend:** Run the following command in the `backend/` folder:

  ```bash
  python app.py 
  ```

The backend server will run on http://localhost:5000 (default Flask port).

2. **Start the frontend:** Run the following command in the `frontend/` folder:

  ```bash
  npm start  # Run in frontend folder
  ```

  The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000.


#### **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes**

- **Both the frontend and backend servers must be running simultaneously** to access the full application.
- If you encounter issues connecting to MySQL, double-check your `config.py` settings and MySQL server status.
